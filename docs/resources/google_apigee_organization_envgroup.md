  it { should exist }
  its('name') { should cmp 'value_name' }
  its('hostnames') { should include 'value_hostname' }
  its('last_modified_at') { should cmp 'value_lastmodifiedat' }
  its('state') { should cmp 'value_state' }
  its('created_at') { should cmp 'value_createdat' }
end

describe google_apigee_organization_envgroup(name: "does_not_exit") do
  it { should_not exist }
end
```

## Properties
