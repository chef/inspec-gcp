platform: gcp
---

## Syntax
A `google_compute_region_security_policy` is used to test a Google RegionSecurityPolicy resource

## Examples
```
      describe google_compute_region_security_policy(project: 'chef-gcp-inspec', region: ' ', name: ' ') do
     it { should exist }
   end
```

## Properties
Properties that can be accessed from the `google_compute_region_security_policy` resource:


  * `kind`: [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#securityPolicyfor security policies 

  * `id`: string (uint64 format) The unique identifier for the resource. This identifier is defined by the server. 

  * `creation_timestamp`: Creation timestamp in RFC3339 text format. 

  * `name`: Name of the resource. Provided by the client when the resource is created. The name must be 1-63 characters long, and comply with RFC1035. Specifically, the name must be 1-63 characters long and match the regular expression [a-z]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])? which means the first character must be a lowercase letter, and all following characters must be a dash, lowercase letter, or digit, except the last character, which cannot be a dash. 

  * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. 

  * `rules`: object A list of rules that belong to this policy. There must always be a default rule which is a rule with priority 2147483647 and match all condition (for the match condition this means match "*" for srcIpRanges and for the networkMatch condition every field must be either match "*" or not set). If no rules are provided when creating a security policy, a default rule with action "allow" will be added. 

    * `kind`: [Output only] Type of the resource. Always compute#securityPolicyRule for security policy rules 

    * `description`: An optional description of this resource. Provide this property when you create the resource. 

    * `priority`: integer An integer indicating the priority of a rule in the list. The priority must be a positive value between 0 and 2147483647. Rules are evaluated from highest to lowest priority where 0 is the highest priority and 2147483647 is the lowest priority. 

    * `match`: object A match condition that incoming traffic is evaluated against. If it evaluates to true, the corresponding 'action' is enforced. 

      * `expr`: object User defined CEVAL expression. A CEVAL expression is used to specify match criteria such as origin.ip, source.region_code and contents in the request header. Expressions containing evaluateThreatIntelligence require Cloud Armor Managed Protection Plus tier and are not supported in Edge Policies nor in Regional Policies. Expressions containing evaluatePreconfiguredExpr('sourceiplist-*') require Cloud Armor Managed Protection Plus tier and are only supported in Global Security Policies. 

        * `expression`: Textual representation of an expression in Common Expression Language syntax. 

        * `title`: Optional. Title for the expression, i.e. a short string describing its purpose. This can be used e.g. in UIs which allow to enter the expression. 

        * `description`: Optional. Description of the expression. This is a longer text which describes the expression, e.g. when hovered over it in a UI. 

        * `location`: Optional. String indicating the location of the expression for error reporting, e.g. a file name and a position in the file. 

      * `versioned_expr`: Preconfigured versioned expression. If this field is specified, config must also be specified. Available preconfigured expressions along with their requirements are: SRC_IPS_V1 - must specify the corresponding srcIpRange field in config. 
      Possible values:
        * SRC_IPS_V1

      * `config`: object The configuration options available when specifying versionedExpr. This field must be specified if versionedExpr is specified and cannot be specified if versionedExpr is not specified. 

        * `src_ip_ranges`: CIDR IP address range. Maximum number of srcIpRanges allowed is 10. 

    * `action`: The Action to perform when the rule is matched. The following are the valid actions:  allow: allow access to target. deny(STATUS): deny access to target, returns the HTTP response code specified. Valid values for STATUS are 403, 404, and 502. rate_based_ban: limit client traffic to the configured threshold and ban the client if the traffic exceeds the threshold. Configure parameters for this action in RateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set. redirect: redirect to a different target. This can either be an internal reCAPTCHA redirect, or an external URL-based redirect via a 302 response. Parameters for this action can be configured via redirectOptions. This action is only supported in Global Security Policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR. throttle: limit client traffic to the configured threshold. Configure parameters for this action in rateLimitOptions. Requires rateLimitOptions to be set for this. 

    * `preview`: boolean If set to true, the specified action is not enforced. 

    * `rate_limit_options`: object Must be specified if the action is "rate_based_ban" or "throttle". Cannot be specified for any other actions. 

      * `rate_limit_threshold`: object Threshold at which to begin ratelimiting.

Valid options are deny(STATUS), where valid values for STATUS are 403, 404, 429, and 502, and redirect, where the redirect parameters come from exceedRedirectOptions below. The redirect action is only supported in Global Security Policies of type CLOUD_ARMOR.
