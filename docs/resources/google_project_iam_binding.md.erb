# google\_project\_iam\_binding

Use the `google_project_iam_binding` InSpec audit resource to test properties of a single GCP project IAM binding.

<br>

## Syntax

A `google_project_iam_binding` resource block declares the tests for a single GCP project IAM binding by role.

    describe google_project_iam_binding(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp',  role: 'roles/compute.admin') do
      it { should exist }
      its('members') {should include 'user:someuser@domain.com' }
    end

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test that a GCP project iam_binding exists

    describe google_project_iam_binding(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp',  iam_binding: 'us-east1-b') do
      it { should exist }
    end

### Test that a GCP project iam_binding is in the expected state

    describe google_project_iam_binding(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp',  iam_binding: 'us-east1-b') do
      its('status') { should eq 'UP' }
      # or equivalently
      it { should be_up }
    end

### Test that a GCP project iam_binding has an expected CPU platform

    describe google_project_iam_binding(project: 'chef-inspec-gcp',  iam_binding: 'us-east1-b') do
      its('available_cpu_platforms') { should include "Intel Skylake" }
    end
